        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

        <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. </li>

        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>

        <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

        <li>The charset element sets our character encoding. The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content. The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>

        <li> The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>

        <li> The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>

        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
        
        <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        
        <ul>

        <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <li>Just because our files are in the same project repository does not mean they know about each other. To do this, we will use the HTML (link) element.</li>

        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>

        <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. </li>

        <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>

        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

        <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, 
          and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. </li>

        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

        <li>Remember that we can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>

    <h2>Git</h2>

   <ul>

    <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

    <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    
    <li>In the command line, pull down the latest main branch by entering git pull origin main.</li>
    <li>Use the following command to stage changes: git add -A </li>
    <li>Use the following command to add a commit message: git commit -m</li>

<section class="card" id="javascript-section">

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
       <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
       <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.
       <li>A for loop contains three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop, The second statement is the condition, & the final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
       <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
